# Intrusion_Detection_System

This code creates a class IntrusionDetection that takes an API URL and a threshold as input.

It has one method called check_traffic() that uses a function called get_current_traffic() to get the current traffic usage.

If the traffic usage exceeds the threshold, it sends a notification to the server using the requests library, with a JSON
payload containing the message "Traffic threshold exceeded on x.x.x.x" (x.x.x.x being the local IP address of the
machine running the script).

The notification is sent to the endpoint http://example.com/notification and the headers contains the content-type as application/json.

If the notification is sent successfully, the script will print a message indicating that the notification has been sent.

This is just an example and it should be adjusted to suit the specific needs of your system and network.

There are many different types of traffic, such as network traffic, system calls, and application-level events, that can be
monitored for suspicious activity.

It's important to use a more secure method to send the notification and to authenticate the endpoint where notifications are sent.
